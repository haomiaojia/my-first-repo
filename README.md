# my-first-repo
I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Finance at Brandeis University, having completed a bachelor's degree in Economics at James Madison University. My academic background and coursework have primarily focused on fixed-income markets, corporate finance, data analysis and visualization.
Here is some information about the Github: 
1.README.md File: The README.md file is located in the project's root directory and provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, usage guidelines, contribution guidelines, and more. It serves as the entry point to convey essential project information.
2.Repository:A repository is the fundamental unit on GitHub for storing a project's code and files. Each repository contains all the project's content, including source code, documentation, images, and more.
3.Pull Request (PR): A pull request is a way to notify others that you've pushed some changes and request merging them. It's at the core of collaboration, enabling others to review your code, provide feedback, and ultimately merge it into the project.
